    bio: About thirty years ago I started to realize the the so-called 'microelectronics revolution' was likely to have profound effects on society, especially as personal data would become much more malleable, store-able and retrievable. That launched me into researching surveillance as a mushrooming feature of today's world. I'm neither a paranoid nor a Pollyanna but I do believe some urgent thought and action is needed on everyday online interactions and data justice.

    bio: Kim Moir works at Mozilla as a Staff Release Engineer.  Kim’s interests lie in optimizing large distributed systems, specifically debugging and optimizing high volume continuous integration farms.  Her favourite thing to do is to replace an existing system with a new one until the legacy system is a tiny shell of its former self and it can be deleted, with no downtime. Kim has spoken at conferences and written extensively about open source and release engineering at scale on her blog https://kimmoir.blog.  She is an advocate for more inclusive and diverse culture within the industry, and practices for more effective teams.<br><br>Outside of work, Kim is a long distance runner, which dovetails nicely with her other hobby of baking cakes and making ice cream. She has an amazing husband and son.

    bio: In between teaching his team about jazz, Jake can be found on the Production Engineering Team at Shopify. He's worked preparing the platform for massive celebrity sales, making Shopify run out of multiple data centres, and the resiliency stack to protect the app against misbehaving resources, and itself. Canadian Geese are his favourite animals. While the hipster movement of his nation has recently taken to eating these poor birds, Jake has yet to taste one. And never plans to. We don't eat our friends.
