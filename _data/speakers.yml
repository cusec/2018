    title: Deployment of Quantum Cryptography
    abstract: The history of cryptography is a history of failures. Stronger ciphers replaced broken ones, to be in turn broken again. Quantum cryptography offers a hope to end this replacement cycle, for its security premises on the laws of physics and not on limitations of human ingenuity and computing. I will tell about ongoing deployment of quantum cryptography networks using fiber-optic and satellite links, and efforts to certify their implementation as secure.

    bio: About thirty years ago I started to realize the the so-called 'microelectronics revolution' was likely to have profound effects on society, especially as personal data would become much more malleable, store-able and retrievable. That launched me into researching surveillance as a mushrooming feature of today's world. I'm neither a paranoid nor a Pollyanna but I do believe some urgent thought and action is needed on everyday online interactions and data justice.

    title: "Software: Profession, Craft or Passion?"
    abstract: Not everyone has the same understanding of just what a software engineering (or software development if you prefer) career is all about. Is it a profession?  Is it a craft? Or is it your life's passion? Why not all three?

    bio: Kim Moir works at Mozilla as a Staff Release Engineer.  Kim’s interests lie in optimizing large distributed systems, specifically debugging and optimizing high volume continuous integration farms.  Her favourite thing to do is to replace an existing system with a new one until the legacy system is a tiny shell of its former self and it can be deleted, with no downtime. Kim has spoken at conferences and written extensively about open source and release engineering at scale on her blog https://kimmoir.blog.  She is an advocate for more inclusive and diverse culture within the industry, and practices for more effective teams.<br><br>Outside of work, Kim is a long distance runner, which dovetails nicely with her other hobby of baking cakes and making ice cream. She has an amazing husband and son.

    title: From Hello World to Goodbye Code
    abstract: At some point, the code you write today will be deleted and replaced with something new.  This talk will discuss the life cycle of a large code base, and how to manage it over time to accommodate rewrites, giving examples from a major rewrite of the Firefox build and release pipeline over the last two years.    You'll learn how to replace components of a running distributed system while keeping it operational, the proverbial replacing the wing of an airplane in flight. Beyoncé lyrics and cat pictures will also be featured.

    bio: In between teaching his team about jazz, Jake can be found on the Production Engineering Team at Shopify. He's worked preparing the platform for massive celebrity sales, making Shopify run out of multiple data centres, and the resiliency stack to protect the app against misbehaving resources, and itself. Canadian Geese are his favourite animals. While the hipster movement of his nation has recently taken to eating these poor birds, Jake has yet to taste one. And never plans to. We don't eat our friends.

    title: Resilient to Failure
    abstract: "When browsing your favourite website, ordering something online or messaging your friends, you expect the internet applications you use to work. Surprising to some, behind the scenes: databases crash, fibres get cut, and whole regions of servers become unavailable. By designing our software systems to be resilient to failure, we can minimize impact so that you can still order those snazzy sneakers in time for your mother's birthday."

    title: Teaching Machines to Learn
    abstract: Machine learning is one of the hottest topics in the tech industry in the last few years. However, despite some resounding successes, many roadblocks remain. I will discuss what is needed to go beyond very specialized systems, as well as give an overview of what doing research in machine learning looks like. In particular, since this domain is at the intersection of many other areas of science, there exist multiple viable directions for each problem.

    bio: I've been a professional programmer for close to 30 years working on software from Assembly up through telecom infrastructure across a range of industries using a variety of languages. I'm currently a fan of Clojure and I'm creating a new language inspired by Clojure that compiles to native executables.

    title: Language as a Tool
    abstract: Creating a piece of software is hard. Yet functioning software is so incredibly valuable, even major errors can be overlooked and worked around. Programming languages are currently the best tools we have to create software, so creating a better language can have outsized benefits. This talk will look at some features a better language would have and discuss how those improve the act of creating software.

    title: More Coverage With Fewer Tests
    abstract: "Tests are important, but code is debt, and testing calcifies interfaces.  I'll briefly introduce a family of testing techniques that yield a lot of value per test: property testing, fuzzing, and concolic testing.  Then I'll talk about how you can start applying property testing right now, giving examples in Python and Rust."

    title: Writing NES Games With Assembly
    abstract: I’d like to take you on a stroll down memory lane and dig into the internals of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) to figure out how it works. While we’re there, we’ll see how to build a simple game for the NES using 6502 assembly with the help of a few modern tools. We’ll gain a new respect for ’80s developers and an appreciation for the high-level languages we have today!

    title: Mistakes I Made as a Junior Software Engineer (So You Don't Have To!)
    abstract: Learn from my mistakes! Most junior software engineers make the same few mistakes their first year on the job, and I was certainly no exception. Cringe along with me as I relive the embarrassing details of actual blunders I made, what I learned from them, and how you can hopefully avoid them in your own career!

    title: Medical Applications of Deep Learning
    abstract: Using deep neural networks to discern patterns in both structured and unstructured data is becoming increasingly popular and powerful. It has commonly been applied to image processing and recommender systems, for example, but can it also be useful in medicine? This talk will explore the fields of brain imaging, both structural and functional, and the impact AI is having on them. Furthermore, it will explore how machine learning can use patient data to predict successful treatments for depression.

    title: From Software Engineer to Product Manager
    abstract: There's a chicken and egg problem that states "to become a Product Manager, you need to be a Product Manager." But hey, everyone has to start somewhere! So, what does it take to transition from a Software Engineer to a Product Manager? Find out in this talk as Kaitlyn Yong guides you through the basics of product management, how to position your technical skill set as an asset, and the interview process as a student.

    title: How Errors In Your Data Are Detected (and Fixed!)
    abstract: Whether it’s noise in a channel or scratches on a CD surface, errors in the movement and transmission of data are bound to occur. The message “I like rice!” could turn into “I like mice!”, or "1101" could turn into "1100". This behaviour can have many consequences, ranging from the bad (software will not work or run) to the very bad (software will do the *wrong* thing). This is where error correcting codes come in! They are used everywhere in communication technology—from CDs and iPods to RAM and deep space satellites. In this talk, I’ll discuss some of the challenges and mathematical techniques used in detecting and correcting errors in transmitted data.
