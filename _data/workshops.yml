    title: Introduction to Pair Programming
    description: Pair programming has proven to be an extremely useful tool in the modern software development world, but is rarely effectively leveraged and receives little attention in undergraduate curricula. After learning about the way pair programming works (and some of the pitfalls!), attendees will be given an opportunity to work in pairs to develop a small program in Python using a test-driven development approach. Attendees should come in pairs and bring at least one laptop with Python installed.

    title: The Operating System Complexion
    description: "Most computer science students have to attend a class called Operating Systems. Taking part in that class, students learn about memory management, process management and concurrency, among other things. If they are lucky, some students will write kernel modules for Linux. Very rarely, if ever, will they implement actual operating system related algorithms. The reason for this is simple: time and complexity. Learning the computer architecture details required to implement even a useless bare bone operating system is just too long. What if this could be changed? What if there was a fully portable, self-contained and open source environment supporting the goal of writing operating system code as part of a related class? We are working on this. And we would like to share it with you."

    title: How we do cloud at Capital One" by using an example of a serverless callable application using lambda and s3.
    description: Cloud is here and is here to stay. We will walk through how to leverage AWS "serverless" infrastructure to create a fast and infinitely scalable web service. You will get to configure AWS to stand up your very own service in the cloud using Lambda and S3. You will also get the opportunity to glimpse into the underbelly of Cloud services and get your hands (a little) dirty. No prior cloud experience is required. Arrive with your internet enabled laptop and personal AWS account to get the best out of this workshop.
