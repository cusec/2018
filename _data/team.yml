  - name: Bernard Cloutier
    position: Head Delegate of Concordia University
    bio: I always thought that coding was amazing. Being able to create anything from nothing but sequences of characters (+ energy drinks + no sleep among other things), that was what got me into Computer Science. And I thought, "That's it, that's the most awesome thing there is out there!". But then I discovered teaching. Teaching tech to be more specific. In other words, helping people understand and use technology by enabling them to grow through it, and I thought to myself, "Hey Bernie, coding is awesome, but this is straight up bananas". So finally, when I met this united family of crazy dedicated students on a mission to make tech an empowering field, something accessible, something fun and that makes you do great things, I knew that was what I needed. That was what got me into CUSEC.
